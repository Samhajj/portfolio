<h3>Creating in a City That Doesn’t Get It: Reflections from Creative Rants</h3>
<p>
  In a world buzzing with innovation, artistry, and disruptive ideas, there’s still one harsh truth many creatives face:<b> some cities just don’t get it</b>. They don’t get the vision, the effort, the process. And yet, creatives keep showing up, creating in spite of silence, doubt, or even opposition.

That was the heartbeat of <strong>Creative Rants,</strong> a gathering of voices that echoed the grit, grace, and guts it takes to thrive in the creative economy. Below are reflections from some of the standout speakers at the event, capturing raw truths and timeless wisdom for anyone daring to make meaning through art, media, or innovation.
</p>
<h4>ADEOLU TIMOTHY: Creating in a City That Doesn’t Get It</h4>
<p>In his session, Adeolu Timothy didn't mince words. He opened with a sobering reality: when you try to break new boundaries in a place that doesn’t value originality, <b>you will face conflict.</b> The system wasn’t designed to support pioneers, and in fact, often punishes them.</p>
<p class="italics"><em>"The system will always conflict when you are trying to break new boundaries." <br></em>
  <em>"People will get away with wasting your time, you won’t. You will face the consequences.”
  </p></em>
  <p>But why keep going? Why create in a place where art feels invisible and ambition sounds like noise?
  
    Because creativity is, first, <b>for you.</b> Before it becomes a product for consumption, it is a form of self-expression and healing. Adeolu challenges creators to keep going because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cities <b>
      do </b>change, often because of one person’s courage to be consistent.</li>
      <li>You’re not just making work for today’s audience, but also for a <b>future</b> one.</li>
      <li>Resistance, as painful as it is, will <b>sharpen</b> your creative voice.</li>
      <li>Success may not bring applause at first, but the act of showing up makes all the difference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In perhaps his most resonant insight, he reminded everyone of the disconnect between admiration and investment:</p>

    <p class="italics"><em>“People like associating with success, but what it takes to succeed — they’re not willing to contribute to it.”</em></p>
<h4>SEYI AJAMU: The Myth of Overnight Success</h4>

   <p>
    Seyi Ajamu took us behind the curtain of what many glamorize, <b>“overnight success”.</b> According to him, there's almost no such thing. Success, in his words, is a struggle, one you survive by not giving up, even when nothing is aligning (yet).</p>
    <p class="italics"><em> “I'm becoming something. There will be shortcomings. But if you don’t give up, it will align.”</em></p>
    
    <p>
    
    He broke down the success journey into three pillars:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
    <b>Passion</b> – But not the shallow, emotional kind. Fuel your passion with knowledge so it becomes powerful.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Diligence</b> – Consistency is still the secret ingredient that separates dreamers from doers.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Patience</b> – It’s not optional.</li> </ol>
    <p>According to Seyi:</p>
    <p class="italics"><em>
      “Whatever patience cannot earn you, nothing can earn.”</em></p>
    <p>
    He emphasized growth as a non-negotiable part of the journey. The wisdom or tools that brought you here will likely not take you <b>further,</b> and that’s okay. You must evolve.</p>
    
    <p>And when you do look at those who seem to “blow” overnight, look again.</p>
      <p> In most cases:</p>
    
      <p class="italics"> <em>“If you really look closely, most overnight success really takes a long time.”</em></p>
    <p>
<h4>PAMILERIN EMMANUEL: Purpose and Pressure — Why Are You Really Creating?</h4>
    <p>
    Pamilerin’s session struck a nerve, especially for creators caught in the whirlwind of performance and productivity. His opening was piercing:</p>
    <p class="italics"> <em>“You are not a creator if you are not creating.”</em></p>
    
     <p>
    In the age of content saturation, where everyone seems to be making something, <b>why</b> you create matters more than ever. Pamilerin identified three driving forces behind meaningful creativity:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Expression</b> – Art gives form to feelings.
    </li>
    <li><b>Impact</b> – Creativity should move someone, somewhere.
      </li>
      <li><b>Profit</b> – And yes, your work deserves to be paid for.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    But the danger is <b>pressure,</b> the kind that doesn’t motivate but <b>drains.</b> The pressure to compare, conform, and compete can cause you to lose your creative voice, especially when you start copying what’s trending.
    </p>
    <p class="italics"><em>“No two creatives are the same. To copy someone else is to lose your originality.”</em></p>
    <p>  
    Pamilerin stressed that <b>freedom</b> begins when you stop creating to impress fellow creatives and start creating to express yourself, or to serve your clients with excellence. You can draw inspiration from others, but your essence must remain intact.
  </p>
  <p class="italics"><em>“If you don’t honour your craft, nobody is going to do it for you.”</em></p>
    
     <p>
    And finally, he offered a reframe on pressure:
  </p>
  <p class="italics"><em> "Pressure can actually be a blessing.”</em></p>
    <p>
    Sometimes, it forces us to dig deeper, to push beyond surface-level work and find our truest voice.</p>
    <h4> ADEDAPO ADEREMI: Brutal Truths on Value, Money, and Time</h4>
    <p></p>
   
    Adedapo Aderemi's session was equal parts honest and uncomfortable, the kind of truths you don't hear often enough in creative circles.</p>
    <p>
    First, a poetic reminder of time:</p>
    
    <p class="italics"><em>“You will not be here for a very long time. At the same time, you will not be here for a while.”</em></p>
    
    <p>
    Translation? Life is short, but long enough to make something meaningful with it.</p>
    
    <p>He also dismantled the glamorization of “exposure”, a currency often used to underpay creatives.</p>
    
    <p class="italics"><em>“Don’t work for exposure. Work for profit.”</em></p>
    
    <p>In one of the most brutally honest admissions of the event, he said:</p>
    <p class="italics"><em>
     “When I post about a work, just know I didn’t make enough money on it as I ought to. If I’m not making money, then you should know I’m working. I can’t lose both ways.”</em></p>
    
    <p>This was a call for creatives to value themselves. Exposure doesn’t pay bills. Likes don’t build legacy. If your art isn’t earning, it should at least be <b>building</b> something, your portfolio, your skill, your brand.</p>
    
   <h4>In Conclusion</h4> 
  <p><b>Creative Rants</b> wasn’t just an event. It was a reminder that <b>creativity is a calling.</b> It’s tough. It’s lonely. It’s often misunderstood. But it’s also sacred. If you’re creating in a city that doesn’t get it, know that you’re not alone. Your voice, your effort, and your persistence matter. You’re not just making art, you’re <b>making room</b> for others to dream louder.</p>
    
   <p>So show up. Create. Grow. And above all - don’t quit.</p>
